Get human-readable timestamp from internet archive URL.
When viewing an archived page, the IA stores the timestamp in this format:
	https://web.archive.org/web/YYYYMMDDhhmmss/<Website original URL>
	
	YYYYMMDDhhmmss: Each character is a digit of a number. If fewer digits,
	leading zeroes are added.
	YYYY = year
	MM = months
	DD = day
	hh = hour
	mm = minute
	ss = second

	This regular expression replaces the timestamp to readable format:
		Find what: [(?'ArchiveURL'https://web.archive.org/web/(?'Year'\d\d\d\d)(?'Month'\d\d)(?'Day'\d\d)(?'Hours'\d\d)(?'Minutes'\d\d)(?'Seconds'\d\d)/(.*)$)]
		Replace with: [$+{Year}-$+{Month}-$+{Day} $+{Hours}:$+{Minutes}:$+{Seconds} Link: $+{ArchiveURL}]
		Search mode: Regular expression.
