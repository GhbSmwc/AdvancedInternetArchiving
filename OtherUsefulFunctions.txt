Get human-readable timestamp from internet archive URL.
When viewing an archived page, the IA stores the timestamp in this format:
	https://web.archive.org/web/YYYYMMDDhhmmss/<Website original URL>
	
	YYYYMMDDhhmmss: Each character is a digit of a number. If fewer digits,
	leading zeroes are added.
	YYYY = year
	MM = months
	DD = day
	hh = hour
	mm = minute
	ss = second

	This regular expression replaces the timestamp to readable format:
		Find what: [https://web.archive.org/web/(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)/(.*)$]
		Replace with: [Archived on \1-\2-\3 \4:\5:\6 Original link: \7]
		Search mode: Regular expression.
